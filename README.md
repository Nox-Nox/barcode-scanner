## Barcode scanner

This is my first programming project written in java using javaFX.
The objective of this project is to get the "grasp" of the logic of how to code: 
- conditionals
- iteration
- variable types
- read/write from/to file
- string manipulation
- data persistence to text file
- create class of an object

This software will: 
- add items in a list by scanning  the barcode and filling up its information in the given field
- update/edit the amount and price of an item and save it in the text file for data persistence
- remove an item
- list all items in a table
- search by typing an item name or any other data of the different columns

This project won't be updated as it is just a point of reference to track my progress and improvements over time.
